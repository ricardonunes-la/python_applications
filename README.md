**Python Applications**

A repository dedicated to taking the first steps in Python programming. Here you will find code examples to learn the fundamentals of the language. #python #learning #beginners


**Prerequisites and installation instructions**

To test the code, PyCharm was used with Anaconda Prompt properly configured.
Alternatively Visual Studio Code was also used.


**Description of the objectives of each code and ideas for future projects**

1. *hello_world.py*

-First application in Python

-Invoking methods

-User input of text

-Printing text

2. *search_google.py*

-Use an API

-Define a function

-Study the for cycle

-Be able to carry out an automatic search on a certain topic, for example, telomeres.

In the future, it would be interesting to have a program that performs automated searches on the latest scientific advancements and consistently presents up-to-date information.

3. *variables.py*

-Variable usage and initialization

-Variable reassignment

-Concatenation of different types

-Local and global variable scopes

-Deletion of variables

4. *functions.py*

-Usage of functions with arguments, default values, return values and variable-length arguments

5. *conditionals.py*

-Usage of conditional statements to compare two numbers and determine their relationship

-Usage of a ternary conditional operator for a concise statement

6. *loops.py*

-Usage of different types of loops, including while, for and for with enumerate()
